    Two global grids are used, φ_particles and φ_fluids, both of which

    on the contribution from particles only, corresponding to the

    same deconvolution will take place, but in addition both the
    particle and fluid contribution will be deconvolved once more,
    corresponding to the interpolation from the grid back to
    the particles.

    The deconvolutions take place in Fourier space. Also while in
    Fourier space, the grids are transformed to the (Fourier
    transformed) potential by multiplying each grid point by

    Which variables to extrapolate to the grid is determined by the
    quantities argument. For details on this argument, see the

    First the variables given in 'quantities' of the components are
    interpolated to the grids; particle components to one grid and
    fluid components to a seperate grid. The two grids are then Fourier
    transformed.
    The potential function is then used to change the value of each grid
    point for both grids. Also while in Fourier space, deconvolutions
    will be carried out, in a different manner for each grid.
    The two grids are added in such a way that they both corresponds to
    the total potential of all components, but deconvolved in the way
    suitable for either particles or fluids. Note that if a fluid
    component have a gridsize different from φ_gridsize, interpolation
    will take place but no deconvolution will be made, leading to
    errors on small scales.
